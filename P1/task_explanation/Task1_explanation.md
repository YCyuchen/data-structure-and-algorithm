# Task1_explanation
In this task, I use python dic{} to implement. As python dic{} is defined as a kind of Hash map, thus for a specific input size, say, in our task is 5.
Time complexity **Big O equals to** $O(1)$
Space complexity  **Big O equals to** $O(1)$

I should have completed this task by using a double linked list. But I got stuck and have no idea how to implement through linked list.
